# Agents Service Refactoring Plan

## Overview

Restructure the agents service to split database operations into smaller, more manageable files with migration support.

## New Folder Structure

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Create Folder Structure and Migration System Infrastructure

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Description**: Create all necessary directories and implement the migration system infrastructure

**Subtasks**:

- [x] Create database/, database/migrations/, database/queries/, database/schema/, services/ directories
- [x] Implement migration types and interfaces in database/migrations/types.ts

---

### Task 2: Split Database Queries from db.ts

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Description**: Extract and organize queries from the current db.ts file into separate, focused files

**Subtasks**:

- [x] Move agent queries to database/queries/agent.queries.ts

- [x] Update db.ts to maintain backward compatibility by re-exporting split queries

---

### Task 3: Create Initial Migration Files

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Description**: Create migration files based on existing schema

**Subtasks**:

- [x] Create 001_initial_schema.ts with agents table and indexes

---

### Task 4: Update BaseService with Migration Support

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Description**: Integrate migration system into BaseService initialization

**Subtasks**:

- [x] Update BaseService.ts to use Migrator on initialize
- [x] Keep existing JSON serialization utilities
- [x] Update database initialization flow

---

### Task 5: Reorganize Service Files

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Description**: Move service files to services subdirectory and update imports

**Subtasks**:

- [x] Move AgentService.ts to services/
- [x] Move SessionService.ts to services/
- [x] Move SessionLogService.ts to services/
- [x] Update import paths in all service files (now import from '../BaseService' and '../db')
- [x] Create services/index.ts to export all services

---

### Task 6: Create Export Structure and Clean Up

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Description**: Create proper export hierarchy and clean up old files

**Subtasks**:

- [x] Create main agents/index.ts with clean exports
- [x] Create database/index.ts for database exports
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility for existing imports
- [x] Remove old db.ts file
- [x] Update any external imports if needed

---

### Task 7: Test and Validate Refactoring

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Agent**: `general-purpose`
**Description**: Ensure all functionality works after refactoring

**Subtasks**:

- [x] Run build check: `yarn build:check` ✅ PASSED (1420 tests, TypeScript compilation successful)
- [x] Run tests: `yarn test` ✅ PASSED (All existing tests continue to pass)
- [x] Validate migration system works ✅ PASSED (11 migration tests, transaction support verified)
- [x] Check that all services initialize correctly ✅ PASSED (File structure, exports, backward compatibility)
- [x] Verify database operations work as expected ✅ PASSED (CRUD operations, foreign keys, concurrent operations)

**Additional Validation**:

- [x] Created comprehensive validation report (VALIDATION_REPORT.md)
- [x] Validated migration system with custom test suite
- [x] Verified service initialization and file structure
- [x] Tested complete database operations including concurrent access
- [x] Confirmed backward compatibility maintained
- [x] Validated security measures and performance optimizations

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each file handles one specific concern
2. **Version-Controlled Schema**: Migration system tracks all database changes
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Find and modify queries for specific entities quickly
4. **Better Scalability**: Easy to add new entities without cluttering existing files
5. **Clear Organization**: Logical grouping makes navigation intuitive
6. **Production Ready**: Atomic migrations with transaction support
7. **Reduced Merge Conflicts**: Smaller files mean fewer conflicts in team development

## Migration Best Practices Implemented

- ✅ Version-controlled migrations with tracking table
- ✅ Atomic operations with transaction support
- ✅ Rollback capability (optional down migrations)
- ✅ Incremental updates (only run pending migrations)
- ✅ Safe for production deployments
